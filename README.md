# Tourism Management Project
 
The following algorithm describes the steps involved in creating and launching a simple Tourism Management System GUI using Java Swing:
1.	Import Required Packages:
	Import the necessary Java Swing and AWT packages for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and handling events.
2.	Define Main Class:
	Create the main class TourismManagementSystem.
3.	Invoke GUI Creation on Event Dispatch Thread (EDT):
	In the main method, use SwingUtilities.invokeLater to ensure that the GUI creation and updates are performed on the Event Dispatch Thread for thread safety.
4.	Define MainFrame Class:
	Create a MainFrame class that extends JFrame.
5.	Set Up MainFrame Constructor:
	In the constructor of the MainFrame class:
	Set the title of the frame.
	Set the default close operation to JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE.
	Set the layout manager for the frame.
	Initialize and add UI components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and panels.
	Define action listeners for handling button clicks and other user interactions.
	Pack the frame to size components appropriately.
	Set the frame to be visible.
6.	Initialize and Add UI Components:
	Create and configure various Swing components (e.g., JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JPanel).
	Add these components to the frame using the appropriate layout manager (e.g., BorderLayout, FlowLayout, GridLayout).
7.	Add Event Handling:
	Implement ActionListener interfaces to define the actions that should be taken when a user interacts with the UI components (e.g., button clicks).
8.	Launch the Application:
	The main method in the TourismManagementSystem class will be executed, creating an instance of MainFrame and displaying the GUI.
